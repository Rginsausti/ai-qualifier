# Architecture Docs

This folder keeps the long-term technical direction for Alma.

## Documents
- `architecture-overview.md`: current system, constraints, and target state.
- `scalability-minimal-infra.md`: how we scale with Vercel + Supabase + Upstash.
- `recommendation-quality.md`: how recommendations become safer and more useful.
- `personalization-loop.md`: how each user gets better guidance over time.
- `implementation-roadmap.md`: phased execution plan with priorities and KPIs.

## Update policy
- Keep decisions concrete and testable.
- Update roadmap status when a phase starts/completes.
- Reflect major architectural changes in `README.md` links.
